## Project Problem
An application developer's objective is to create a successful Android App. To make informed decisions, the developer aims to answer the following questions:
- What app categories are the most popular?
- What is the most optimal pricing strategy for app success?
- How can user ratings be maximized to boost the app's performance?

## Project Walkthrough
1. Cleaning procedures to handle missing or inconsistent data in Jupyter Notebooks.
2. Formatting and structuring the dataset for analysis.
3. Realize an exploratory analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset.
4. Realize the analysis.
5. Based on the SQL analysis, derived actionable insights and recommendations to guide app development decisions. 

## Project Insights
The analysis has yielded the following key insights:
- Paid apps tend to exhibit higher ratings, but have lower install rates.
- Categories such as dating, maps and navigation, tools, video players, and lifestyle do not meet the current market needs, indicating potential opportunities.
- A new app should aim for an average rating above 4.19 to be competitive.
- The high volume of apps in communication, social, video player, productivity and game categories indicates a potentially saturated market.
